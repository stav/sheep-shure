Perfect. Below is a **structured, detailed prompt** you can paste directly into Claude (or any coding AI). It reflects everything we discussed — but in a clean, modern, build-ready way.

# PROMPT FOR CLAUDE

I want to build a modern, local-first desktop application for Medicare insurance agents to manage their Book of Business (client portfolio).

This tool is initially for my personal use but should be architected in a way that allows future commercialization (SaaS subscription model with optional cloud features).

Please design the architecture and generate an implementation plan.

---

## 🎯 CORE GOAL (Version 1 – Local First)

Build a desktop app that:

1. Runs entirely locally on the agent’s machine.
2. Stores all client data locally (no mandatory cloud storage).
3. Imports client data easily from:

   * Excel (.xlsx)
   * CSV
   * Potential future CRM exports (design import layer modularly)

The goal is for agents to NEVER feel like they are giving away their book of business.

---

## 🧱 CORE FEATURES (V1)

### 1. Portfolio Dashboard (Home Screen)

When opening the app, show:

* Total active clients
* New clients added this month
* Clients lost this month
* Pending disenrollments (if available)
* Breakdown by:

  * Plan type (MAPD, D-SNP, etc.)
  * Carrier
  * Zip code
* Visual summary (charts/graphs)

This should feel modern and clean — not like 1990s insurance software.

---

### 2. Client Detail View

For each client:

* Name
* DOB
* Plan name
* Carrier
* Effective date
* Status (Active / Pending / Disenrolled)
* Notes
* Commission tracking field (future expansion-ready)

Design data schema cleanly and extensibly.

---

### 3. Smart Reporting Engine

Allow agents to generate reports such as:

* All D-SNP clients
* All clients in ZIP code X
* Clients added in last 30 days
* Clients by carrier
* Disenrollments in last 60 days

Reports should:

* Be exportable to PDF
* Be exportable to Excel
* Be printable

Design filtering logic cleanly.

---

## 🔐 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

* Local database encryption (at rest)
* No data leaves device in V1
* Secure authentication to open app (local login / password)
* Architecture must allow HIPAA-compliant expansion later

---

## 💰 FUTURE EXPANSION (Design For This Now)

Even if not implemented in V1, the architecture should allow:

### 1. Commission Tracking Module

* Track commissions by carrier
* Track expected vs received
* Detect missing payments
* Reconciliation tools

### 2. Carrier API Integrations

Design abstraction layer for:

* Connecting to carrier systems (Aetna, Anthem, etc.)
* Handling messy legacy systems
* API key storage securely
* Future automation of:

  * Real-time status updates
  * Disenrollment detection

### 3. Optional Cloud Sync (Paid Tier)

Future model:

Base Tier:

* Fully local-only

Premium Tier:

* Secure encrypted cloud sync
* Mobile access
* Cross-device access

Cloud must be:

* End-to-end encrypted
* Agents maintain ownership of data
* Clear trust architecture

---

## 💳 Subscription & Licensing Model

App should:

* Run locally
* Require periodic online license verification
* Disable if subscription inactive
* Never upload book of business for license check

Think Lightroom-style subscription model.

---

I'd like to make sure we have the following features:

Book-of-business status checker
Commission data scraper
Medicare plan data viewer
Medicare CRM
Medicare/Medicaid eligibility checker

---

## 🧠 UX Requirements

* Clean modern UI
* Extremely simple for non-tech-savvy agents
* Fast search
* Fast filtering
* Minimal clicks
* Zero “insurance legacy software” feel

---

## 🏗 TECH STACK (Recommend)

Please propose:

* Best framework for local desktop app:

  * Electron?
  * Tauri?
  * Native?
* Best local database:

  * SQLite?
* Encryption approach
* Licensing verification architecture
* Clean modular structure for scaling into SaaS later

Explain pros and cons of each decision.

---

## 🚀 Deliverables I Want From You

1. Proposed technical architecture
2. Database schema
3. Modular folder structure
4. Step-by-step build plan
5. Future SaaS scaling roadmap
6. Security considerations checklist

Be opinionated. Challenge bad assumptions. Suggest improvements.

This must be designed as a serious commercial-grade product, not a hobby script.

If you'd like, next we can:

* Refine the monetization strategy
* Decide exact tech stack
* Or design the MVP database schema together

You're thinking in the right direction — now we make it sharp.
